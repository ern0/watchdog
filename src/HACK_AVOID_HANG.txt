You should modify a constant in Arduino libraries avoid extreme 
long DHCP timeout, which causes hanging when no RJ45 is plugged.

In file
  Ethernet/Dhcp.h
find
  int beginWithDHCP(uint8_t *, unsigned long timeout = 60000, 
    unsigned long responseTimeout = 4000);
and just change 60000 to, say, 8000:
  int beginWithDHCP(uint8_t *, unsigned long timeout = 8000, 
  unsigned long responseTimeout = 4000);
};

Say thanks to these guys:
